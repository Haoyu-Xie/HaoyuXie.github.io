<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D student supervised by Prof. [Chong Fu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=xq76xEMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at [NEU](http://www.neu.edu.cn/), China and remote visiting [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) in [University of Syndey](https://www.sydney.edu.au), supervised by Dr.[Chang Xu](http://changxu.xyz). 
I received my Master degree and Bachelor degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, NEU in 2020 and 2018, respectively.

My Primary research interest is computer vision with a focus on **semi-supervised learning** and **semantic segmentation**. By inducing priors that humans utilize into training of deep neural networks, I hope to understand the learning of our deep models better and to enable the models to understand visual data with minimal human supervision. Besides, I have an additional interest in **3D Dense Prediction Task** and **Diffusion Model** (Under investigation).

<font color=red> I have completed my Ph.D graduation project. I am looking for a long postdoctoral job, and I accept early interns for postdoctoral work (remote or onsite)!!! </font>

<b>Boosting Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Probabilistic Representations </b>, in AAAI 2023, <b>Oral</b><br>
In this paper, we redefine the representation in pixel-wise contrastive learning from a perspective of probability theory. We consider the probability and model the representation as random variable, namely Probabilistic Representation. <br>
