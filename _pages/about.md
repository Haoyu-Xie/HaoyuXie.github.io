<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a current Ph.D student at [NEU](http://www.neu.edu.cn/), China and remote visiting [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) in [University of Syndey](https://www.sydney.edu.au), supervised by Dr.[Chang Xu](http://changxu.xyz). 
My Primary research interest is computer visionm with a focus on **semi-supervised learning** and **semantic segmentation**. By inducing priors that humans utilize into training of deep neural networks, I hope to understand the learning of our deep models better and to enable the models to understand visual data with minimal human supervision. Besides, I have additional interest in **3D Dense Prediction Task** and **Diffusion Model**.

<font color=red> I have a postdoc plan and am open to pre-intern!!! </font>
